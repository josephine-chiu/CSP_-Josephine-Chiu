        <h4>The Burning Bush - Hans Zimmer</h4> 
            <p class="bush"> The Burning Bush is from the movie The Prince of Egypt and it completely <i>destroyed</i> me when I first to it. It still does to this day. It's so emotional that it might as well knock your socks off. Hans Zimmer masterfully constructs a calm setting with tranquil strings playing in the background. However, as the situation intensifies, so does the music. Such an awe-invoking piece that will forever be remembered.</p>

                <p>Another one of my favorite songs is Found/Tonight.
                It's a mashup of two songs: "The Story of Tonight" from Hamilton
                and "You Will Be Found" from Dear Evan Hansen (DEH). This song combines
                emotion and meaning together to make a masterpiece. What's even 
                better is that Ben Platt (actor of Evan Hansen) sings the Hamilton 
                song and Lin Manuel Miranda (Alexander Hamilton) sings DEH!</p>
