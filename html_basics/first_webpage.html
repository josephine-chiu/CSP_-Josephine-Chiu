        <h1>The Power of Music</h1>
        <h2>Test Drive - John Powell</h2>
            <p> When I first watched How To Train Your Dragon, I did not realize how absolutely <b>AMAZING</b> it is. My favorite piece from the enitre franchise is Test Drive, obviously. The thing about John Powell, the main composer of the series, is that he made this piece so simple, yet so powerful. He uses many instruents such has french horns to perfectly emulate the feeling of soaring through the sky.</p>

        <h3>The Burning Bush - Hans Zimmer</h3> 
            <p> The Burning Bush is from the movie The Prince of Egypt and it completely destroyed me when I first to it. It still does to this day. It's so emotional that it might as well knock your socks off. Hans Zimmer masterfully constructs a calm setting with tranquil strings playing in the background. However, as the situation intensifies, so does the music. Such an awe-invoking piece that will forever be remembered.</p>
