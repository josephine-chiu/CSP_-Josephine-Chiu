        <h1>Taylor Swift: The Most Underated Song</h1>
        <h2>Soon You'll Get Better ft. The Chicks</h2>
            <p> This song has a very special place in my heart. It's also not very known to many Taylor Swift fans for reasons I don't know. It was released in 2019 in the Lover album. Taylor has never performed this song live for a particular reason: it talks about her mom getting cancer. Since this is such a sensitive topic, she decided that this song not be performed live. </p>
