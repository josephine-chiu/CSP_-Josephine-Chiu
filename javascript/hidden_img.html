        <h1>When Tigers Go Extinct</h1> <!--Largest header tag-->
        <h2>What's gonna happen?</h2>
            <p>If the tiger was to go extinct, a large portion of the Asian animal population would change exponentially. Let me explain. The Wild boar and Sambar Deer are the tiger's main prey. If tigers died out, these populations would literally intensify since they donâ€™t have a natural predator keeping their numbers in check. Once there are too many herbivores in the area, the grass will eventually diminish and be overeaten. Once that happens, those populations (grass, boar, deer) will collapse. </p>

        <h3>What's making them die?</h3>
            <p>Poaching is what's killing all the tigers in Asia. That's really bad. Tiger fur, teeth, and even whiskers are sold on the Black Market at massive prices. As a result of these habits, the tiger population continues to drop like a fly. Many programs like the Wold Wildlife Fund are stepping up to protect this endangered species. Although it won't save the population entirely, a step is a step.</p>
