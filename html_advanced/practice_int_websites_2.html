        <h2>Review of CS 1030</h2>
            <p> This class has been one of the most eye-opening classes I've ever taken. It started with programming in Python and C. Oh my goodness was that an <b>ADVENTURE.</b> Although I was terrified of VS code at first, I find it very useful to write code. Making a website has probably been my favorite thing because of how simple it is! And I can't wait to make my website look all cute and pretty!</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Projects So Far!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Updating my first website</li>
                <li>The programming Final. (I did a Text Based Adventure Game!)</li>
                <li>FizzBuzz in Python</li>
                <li>On April 18, 2020, Taylor performed this song as part of the <i>One World: Together at Home.</i></li>
                <li>The album, <i>Lover</i> was an album that acted like a letter to love which invoked all the feelings that come with love.</li>
            </ul>
