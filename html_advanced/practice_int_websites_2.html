        <h2>Review of CS 1030</h2>
            <p> This class has been one of the most eye-opening classes I've ever taken. It started with programming in Python and C. Oh my goodness was that an <b>ADVENTURE.</b> Although I was terrified of VS code at first, I find it very useful to write code. Making a website has probably been my favorite thing because of how simple it is! And I can't wait to make my website look all cute and pretty! P.S Python is my favorite programming language and C is literally another language, pun intended.</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Projects So Far!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Updating my first website in HTML</li>
                <li>The programming Final. (I did a Text Based Adventure Game)</li>
                <li>FizzBuzz in Python</li>
                <li>Making the financial calculator (it was a doozy, but I figured it out)</li>
                <li><i>UPDATING</i> the financial calculator with functions (it made the entire program so much cleaner!)</li>
            </ul>
